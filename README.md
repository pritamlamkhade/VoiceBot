# VoiceBot
A voice assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands i.e. by interpreting human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistantsâ€™ questions, control home automation devices, and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, open or close any application etc with verbal commands.

Having said that, how cool it would be to build a simple voice-based desktop/laptop assistant that has the capability to:-
  1. Open the subreddit in the browser.
  2. Open any website in the browser.
  3. Tells you the current weather and temperature of almost any city
  4. Tells you the current time.
  5. Greetings
  6. Tells you latest news feeds.
  7. Tells you about almost anything you ask.
  8.Tells you a joke
